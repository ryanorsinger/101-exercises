This is part of the automated tests.\n- Once you've made your own fork, go to \"Run\" then \"Restart Session\" to clear up any error messages.\n- Each *assert* line is both an example and a test that tests for the presence and functionality of the instructed exercise. \n\n## The only 3 conditions that produce no errors:\n1. When you make a fresh **fork** of the project.\n2. When you go to \"Run\" and then click \"Restart Session\"\n3. When every single assertion passes\n\n\n## Outline\n- Each cell starts with a problem statement that describes the exercise to complete.\n- Underneath each problem statement, learners will need to write code to produce an answer.\n- The **assert** lines test to see that your code solves the problem appropriately\n- Many exercises will rely on previous solutions to be correctly completed\n- The `print(\"Exercise is complete\")` line will only run if your solution passes the assertion test(s)\n- Be sure to create programmatic solutions that will work for all inputs:\n- For example, calling the `is_even(2)` returns `True`, but your function should work for all even numbers, both positive and negative.\n- To \"run a cell\" of code, click the cell and press \"Shift+Enter\" on your keyboard or click on the play button to the left of the cell. This will execute the Python code contained in the cell. Executing a cell that defines a variable is important before executing or authoring a cell that depends on that previously created variable assignment."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Getting Started\n0.
